      I'm very much interested in watching movies. I like to explore new places.

<h2>Tom and Jerry</h2>
<p>A legendary rivalry reemerges when Jerry moves into New York City's finest hotel on the eve of the 
    wedding of the century, forcing the desperate event planner to hire Tom to get rid of him. As mayhem 
    ensues, the escalating cat-and-mouse battle soon threatens to destroy her career, the wedding, 
    and possibly the hotel itself.<li>"They are fighting with each other, for each other. The bittersweet 
    moments of Tom and Jerry taught us that life is meaningless without sharing fun and laughter with 
    each other."</li></p>
