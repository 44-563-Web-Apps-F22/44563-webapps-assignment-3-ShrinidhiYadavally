<p> In 2014, the Athletics Department officially welcomed a squirrel mascot to its department-wide branding
     scheme.  The albino squirrel has been a part of the college's history dating back to the 1970s and has
      become an endearing icon in recent years.  Often found in Tappan Square, the squirrels have held a 
      special place in the hearts of many Obies.  The local folklore is if you see one of the squirrels on
       campus, you will have good luck that day.
